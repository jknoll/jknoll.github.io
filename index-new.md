## Introduction

I've recently conducted an artificial intelligence and machine learning deep dive, hands-on coding and hackathon competition as a way to create tangible implementations and connect with others in the industry. Over the course of this deep dive, I've been able to compete in a broad spectrum of competitions, tally a number of wins, and accumulate more than $42,000 in GPU and API prize credits in a short time.
